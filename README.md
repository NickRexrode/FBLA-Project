# FBLA-Project
A program to manage the issuance of E-Books to a class of students. This program was made for the Coding and Programming Event (FBLA 2019).

In this README, I will tell you how to use the program!  Although it is fairly straitforward in my opinon, instructions are always a helpful addition.

Firstly, I've included both the source code as well as a runnable JAR file.  To view the source code, you can either use GitHub to view it, or import it into your IDE.  To run the JAR file, make sure you have Java installed on your computer!

Instructions:
  When you open the program you will be greeted with an interface.  There will be two buttons, one saying "View Books" the other saying "Admin".  The "View Books" is meant for students to browse books without the ability to checkout or manage other students info.  The "Admin" button will bring you to the page where you can browse/ assign/return book.  You can also manage students in this area.  Every list, being either books or students, will come with a search bar!
  
  If You clicked the "Admin" button, you will have a bar at the top with 5 options: New Book, View Books, View Students, Add Student and Log Out.  I will give you instructions for every page here:
    
    New Book:
    To add a new Book click on new book.  You will then be shown three text boxes and then a submit button.  Enter the title, author and topics, which are seperated by commas.  If you do not have a topic, clear the text box and clear it blank.  You could also put "none".  Once you are done inputing information, you can click "create new Book".  It it worked you will get a confirmation message.
    
    View Books:
    When you select the view Books Menu option, you will be shown a screen that has a list and a search bar.  You can search for the book you want.  You can select a book by clicking on it.  This will show you more information about that specific book, such as author and topics.
    
    View Students:
    When you click this Menu option, you will be directed to a screen with a List of Names.  These are the students that are in the system.  If you select a name, you will be shown two new buttons (Assing and return book), as well as, another list that will show you the books the student has checked out.  If you select one of these books, you can see more information about it.  (author, topics.)  Finally you will also see an area where you can edit the student's information.  To edit the information, just enter the new values in the text boxes. And then click the "Edit Account" button.  The changes will be made.  The buttons assign and return book will open new windows to assign and returns books, respectively.  In the new windows, you need to select the book and click assign or return, again, respectfully.
    
    Add Student:
    In this tab you will be able to add new Students into the System.  In the text boxes enter the appropriate information.  The system will not let you sumbit info that will cause errors.  When you hit the submit button, the new account will be created.  You can view the account in the View Student menu
    
    Log out:
    This button will obviosly log you out.
  
Thanks!!
